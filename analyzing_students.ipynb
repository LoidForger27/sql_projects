    "# ✅ Conclusion:\n",
    "Based on our results, we can reasonably agree with the study: international students experience higher risks of mental health difficulties compared to general populations, and both social connectedness and acculturative stress significantly contribute to depression. Length of stay adds another dimension students often start with high stress, and their depression scores can worsen if adjustment or support is lacking."
