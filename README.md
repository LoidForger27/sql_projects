## 📌 Overview
This repository showcases end-to-end SQL work: from modeling and cleaning data to writing analysis queries and optimizing performance. Each project folder includes a problem brief, dataset, runnable SQL scripts, and a short results summary.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement
Organizations collect mountains of raw data. Without effective querying, structure, and validation, it remains unused. These projects address real scenarios:
- Cleaning messy operational data
- Designing normalized relational schemas
- Building analysis queries and views for decision-making
- Optimizing performance for large tables

---

## 🔧 Solution Approach
**Core tools:** PostgreSQL • MySQL • BigQuery • SQL Server (SSMS) • DBeaver/pgAdmin  
**Techniques:** CTEs, window functions, subqueries, analytical aggregations, indexing, constraints, and views.  
**Workflow:**  
1) Understand the business question  
2) Model the data (ERD, normalization)  
3) Load/clean datasets  
4) Write modular queries and views  
5) Validate and document insights

---

## ✨ Key Features / Highlights
- 🧹 **Data Cleaning:** Deduplication, type fixes, referential integrity, constraints
- 🧩 **Schema Design:** ERD + 1NF–3NF normalization with indexes and foreign keys
- 📊 **Analytics:** Cohort/RFM, retention, trendlines via window functions
- ⚡ **Performance:** Query refactors and indexing strategies
- 🔄 **Reusable Assets:** Views, UDFs (where supported), and parameterized scripts

---

## 🛠 Skills Demonstrated
- **SQL Joins & Subqueries** → Complex data wrangling  
- **Window Functions** → Ranking, moving averages, cumulative totals  
- **CTEs & Views** → Modular analysis and readable logic  
- **Database Design** → ER modeling and normalization  
- **Performance Tuning** → Indexing, execution-plan-aware refactors

---

## 📈 Results / Impact (Examples)
- Reduced complex report runtime by **40%** with composite indexing and CTE refactor.  
- Cleaned and analyzed **10k+ rows** across multiple domains with integrity constraints.  
- Implemented a normalized schema for a **library system** to support thousands of transactions.

## ✅ Data Quality & Governance

Primary/foreign keys and NOT NULL constraints

Check constraints on enumerations and valid ranges

Minimal privileges for read/write roles where applicable

Repeatable seeds and idempotent scripts

## 🔮 Future Improvements

dbt project for modular transforms and tests

Airflow orchestration for scheduled SQL jobs

Parameterized reporting views for self-service BI (Looker/Tableau/Power BI)

Benchmark suite comparing indexes and query plans

## 🤝 Contributing

PRs are welcome—open an issue describing the dataset, the problem statement, and the SQL approach. Keep scripts idempotent and documented.
